# Unix Shell
---
This project implements a simple Unix shell. The shell is the heart of the commandline interface, and thus is central to the Unix/C programming environment. Mastering use of the shell is necessary to become proficient in this world; knowing how the shell itself is built is the focus of this project.


# Overview
---
The shell should operate in this basic way: when you type in a command (in response to its prompt), the shell creates a child process that executes the command you entered and then prompts for more user input when it has finished. The shells you implement will be like, but simpler than, the one you run in Unix. If you do not know what shell you are running, it's probably bash.
